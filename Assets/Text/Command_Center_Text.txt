(seems to be a note left by the Captain) The crew has been concerned about the general stability of the Ancora. 
Stella came up to me this morning informing me that we've been having issues with our oxygen levels in the engineering wing.
I'm scheduled to have a meeting with the maintenance council in a week.
Hopefully, we can convince them to decommission this ship.
The spacecraft has had numerous issues from electrical failures to fluctuating oxygen levels. 
I can't put my crew at risk any longer; it's time for the Ancora to retire.

Stella: No...this can't be happening! The damn thing is broken...what am I going to do? I can't fix the ship...I don't even know how ships work.
I mean...the only option I have is to try to repair the communication terminal. But...what tools do I even need? Wasn't there some sort of repair manual that every ship is supposed to have?
Think, Stella, think!
Yeah, yeah...I remember hearing that in a meeting when I was first commissioned. The manual is supposed to be located in the engineering wing of every ship owned by NASA.
I think I've even seen it in our engineering wing now that I think about it! Gotta go there and find that manual.
